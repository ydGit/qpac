\section*{Acknowledgment}
My sincere gratitude goes to all reviewers of the early drafts of
the book for their valuable feedback. In particular, I want to thank Dr. Alex
Rylyakov, Dr. Mikhail Makouski, Prof. Anton Kananovich,
and Dr. Mohammad Teimourpour. To Dr. Teimourpour I must give separate
thanks for numerous discussions, helpful suggestions on material
presentation, and hospitality.

\emph{My friends, discussing the book with you was both illuminating
and fun.}

Finally, special acknowledgment must be given to my son, Daniel, for
his help with fixing colors in many figures.
