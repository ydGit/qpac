$K$ and $E_k$ -- Kinetic energy of a system.\\
$\Pi$ and $E_p$ -- Potential energy of a system.\\
$E$ -- Total mechanical energy ($E=E_K+E_P$) written in terms of velocity $v$ and position $x$.\\
$H$ -- Hamiltonian of a system: $H=K+\Pi$. Differs from $E$ because
kinetic energy written in terms of \emph{momentum} $p$ instead of velocity.\\
$L$ -- Lagrangian (Lagrange function) of a system: $L=E_K-E_p$. It is the ``imbalance''
of energies.\\
$\Delta x$ -- Change of a value of a variable $x$.\\
$\delta x$ -- ``Tiny'' change of a value of a variable $x$.\\
$\partial$ -- Rate of change.\\
$\partial_{t}$ -- Rate of change with respect to time.\\
$\partial_{x}$ -- Rate of change with respect to variable $x$
(e.g. position).\\
$\partial_{t}f$ -- Rate of change of $f$ with respect to $t$.\\
It means exactly the following
\[
\partial_t f = \frac{\delta f}{\delta t}=\frac{f(t+\delta t)-f(t)}{\delta t}\,.
\]\\
$\vec{\xi}$ -- State of a system in Hamiltonian dynamics. It is a vector
with components $\vec{\xi}=(x,p)$.\\
$\hat{J}$-- Operation (operator) of rotation by 90 degrees.\\
$\hat{R}(\theta)$ -- Operation (operator) of rotation by $\theta$.\\
$h$ -- Quantum of action (Planck's constant). In SI units its numerical
value is $h=6.626\times10^{-34}(J\cdot s)$.\\
$\hbar$ -- ``Reduced Planck's constant''. A convenience notation
for often used combination $\hbar=h/(2\pi)$.\\
$A$ -- Action.\\
$\Psi$ -- Quantum state.\\
$|\Psi\rangle$ -- Quantum state vector.\\
$\phi,\,\theta$ -- Angle variables.\\
$\omega$ -- Angular speed (also angular velocity). Often it has
the following meaning: $\omega=\partial_{t}\theta$ .\\
$\vec{e_{1}},\vec{e_{2}}$ -- Basis vectors. Usually they have unit
length and point in mutually perpendicular directions.\\
$z$ -- Arbitrary \emph{numeric} variable, $\vec{z}$ -- arbitrary
\emph{vector} variable, $\hat{z}$ -- arbitrary \emph{operator}.\\
$\overset{\circ}{A}$ -- Angstrom, a unit of length in the world
of atoms. $1\overset{\circ}{A}=10^{-9}(m)$. Hydrogen atom is about
$1\overset{\circ}{A}$ in diameter.\\
$c$ -- Speed of light in vacuum.\\
$\nu$ -- Frequency of oscillations measured as the number of
oscillations per second, in Hz.
