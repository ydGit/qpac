Below is the list of various physical constants used in these notes.\\
$q_e = 1.6\times 10^{-19}\,(C)$ -- Charge quantum (charge of an
electron).\\
$m_e = 9.1\times 10^{-31}\,(kg)$ -- rest-energy (aka mass) of an electron.\\
$k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 9\times 10^9\,(N\cdot m^2/C^2)$ --
Coulomb constant -- force between two unit charges 1 meter apart.\\
$10^{-9}$ s = 1 nanosecond -- the unit of time in atomic world. It is a ``heartbeat
of atoms''.\\
$1\, (eV) = q_e\, (J)$ -- 1 electron-volt. It is the kinetic energy
an electron would acquire when accelerated by a simply 1V battery. A
tiny value.\\
$m_ec^2/q_e= 0.5\, MeV$ -- rest-energy of an electron measured in
electron-volts. Roughly speaking, we will need half a million
1-volt batteries to accelerate an electron to make its kinetic energy
comparable to its rest-energy. \\
$k=100\,(N/m)$ is a spring constant of a spring that stretches by 0.1
of a meter when 1 kilogram mass is attached to it.\\
