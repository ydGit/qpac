\chapter{Mathematics}\label{ch:Mathematics}

\lettrine[lines=2]{\color{darkocre}I}{n} the previous chapter we
learned about numbers and various relations between them. As a
particular class of relations we discussed functions. We introduced
\emph{binary} and \emph{unary} functions and different ways
functions can be combined (\emph{composed}) to produce new
functions. We also learned
that functions can be
represented in various ways and that none of those different
representations defines
the concept of function completely. Each representation of a function
highlighted some important aspect of it.

\section{Arrows}

To arrive at the idea of vectors we will start with simple geometrical
objects -- arrows in a plane, as illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:arrowsSpace}.

    imaginable arrows taken as one set form the arrow space
    $\overset{\Rightarrow}{A}$.}
  \label{fig:arrowsSpace}
\end{SCfigure}

Symbolically, we will denote vectors by placing an arrow over letters:
\[
\vec{a}\,,\vec{b}\,,\vec{c}\,,\ldots\,,\vec{\alpha}\,,\vec{\beta}\,.

\section{Application: Circular Motion}
Let us examine how the concepts and tools discussed above can be applied to a simple case of circular motion.  

Consider a  particle moving in a circle with the radius $R$, as shown in Figure X. If we choose the center of the circle as the reference point, we can specify the position of the particle using an arrow $\ket{r}$. During motion the direction of this arrow is constantly changing, but its length $R$ remains the same.  

After a short time interval $\delta t$, the position of the particle changes by $\delta\ket{r}$:
\[
\ket{r_t}\quad\rightarrow\quad \ket{r_{t+\delta t}} = \ket{r_t}+\delta\ket{r}\,.
\]

The length of the path covered by the particle during the time interval $\delta t$ can be approximated by the length of the arc  $\delta L=R\delta\theta=v\delta t$. The arrow $\delta\ket{r}$ can be written as $\delta L\ket{u}$ where $\ket{u}$ is the vector of unit length pointing in the direction of motion. This unit vector can be constructed from $\ket{r}$ by scaling it down by $R$ and then rotating counter-clockwise with the operator $\op{J}$: 
\[
\delta\ket{r}=R\delta\theta\op{J}\left(\frac{\ket{r}}{R}\right)\,.
\]
Since $\op{J}$ is a linear operator, the $R$ cancels and we can write
\[
\frac{\delta\ket{r}}{\delta t}=\frac{\delta\theta}{\delta t}\op{J}\ket{r}\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad
\partial_t\ket{r}=\omega\op{J}\ket{r}\,,
\]
where we introduced the angular speed $\omega=\partial_t\theta$. Finally, by applying the $\op{J}$ operator to both sides of the last equation, we can cast it into the "Schrodinger" form:
\[
\op{J}\partial_t\ket{r}=-\omega\ket{r}\,.
\]

  \it
\begin{itemize}
\item Arrows in a plane provide a simple model for vectors.
\item Arrows can be manipulated in ways analogous to numbers: Two arrows
  be added, an arrow can be ``scaled'' (stretched or compressed). Arrows form
  an algebra.
\item Basis is an extremely important concept. Basis is a set of
  objects (arrows) that can be used to ``build'' all other similar
  objects (arrows). At the same time, basis can not be used to build
  itself -- basis arrows are independent.
\end{itemize}
