\lettrine[lines=2]{\color{darkocre}T}{he} first type of operators -- and
corresponding tensors -- that we encountered has a simple type:
\[
\op{L}\,\vec{a} = \vec{b}\,.
\]
It is a linear unary function mapping vectors into vectors.

We are looking for a binary operator $\op{\sigma}$ that yields a number

\]

We are looking for a binary operator $\op{\sigma}$ that yields a number
based on two vectors:
\[
\op{\sigma}\,\vec{a}\,\vec{b}=x\,.
\]
We will call this operator $\op{\sigma}$ \emph{dol}-operator\footnote{This is not a
standard terminology. }, based on the key letters of the phrase
``\underline{d}egree of \underline{o}ver\underline{l}ap''.

\begin{myrem}{Reminder}
When we say that an operator $\op{\Gamma}$ is given or known, we
mean that we know how it acts on \emph{any vector} $\vec{a}$:
\[
\op{\Gamma}\,\vec{a} = x_a\,.
\]
\end{myrem}

Array of equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \op{\Gamma}_1\,\vec{e}_1 & = & 1\,\\
  \op{\Gamma}_1\,\vec{e}_2 & = & 0\,\\
  \op{\Gamma}_1\,\vec{e}_3 & = & 0\,\\
  \ldots
\end{eqnarray}

  \it
\begin{itemize}
\item Two vectors can be compared for similarity by calculating the
  ``degree of overlap''. The longer two vectors are and the closer
  their mutual direction -- the greater the overlap is.
\item Degree of overlap can be described by a binary linear operator
  $\op{\sigma}$. This operator is closely related to the concept of
  scalar product of two vectors.
\item When scalar product (or, equivalently, degree of overlap) is
  defined for vectors, each vector receives a ``special relative'' --
  conjugate vector -- that lives in different vector space, called
  conjugate or dual space.
\item When the degree-of-overlap operator $\op{\sigma}$ is partially
  applied, the result is a unary linear operator that yields a number
  for every input vector. Importantly, such an operator is also a
  vector, albeit not an arrow-like vector.
\end{itemize}
